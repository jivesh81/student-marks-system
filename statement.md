## Student Marks Management System

### Overview

This project is a console-based application to manage student marks for a class. It provides basic operations to store, retrieve, and analyze student performance data.

### Problem

Teachers and students need a simple way to keep track of marks without using complex software. This program solves that problem by providing an easy-to-use system that runs on any computer with Python.

### Objectives

- Store student names and their marks
- Allow easy viewing of all student records
- Identify the student with highest marks
- Update marks when needed
- Remove student records
- Calculate average marks of the class

### Limitations

- Data is not saved permanently and will be lost when program closes
- No support for multiple subjects
- Cannot handle large number of students efficiently
- Basic text interface only

### Future Improvements

- Save data to a file
- Add multiple subjects support
- Create graphical user interface
- Generate report cards
- Add more statistics and analysis features
